# Problem-Solving

This repository will guide us with the different level of programming approaches.

Sequencially we will continue with the different approaches we will apply in the problems related to data-structures and algorithms.


## Plateforms that we will use to solve problems -->

1. Hackerrank
2. Leetcode
3. Codechef


## Languages we will use as a tool to enjoy this problem-solving journey -->

1. C / C++
2. Python
3. SQL


## Data Structure topics that we will cover -->

Array
String
Two pointers
Bit Manipulation
Stack
Queue
Heap
Linked Lists
Trees
Graphs


## Algorithms that we get to know in this journey -->

1. Searching
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search
2. Sorting
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Heap Sort


## The structure and location of program we will follow to solve a problem -->

FolderName  -   PlateformName

Category    -   Applicable category 

FileName    -   The name of problem


## Program structure

1. Title :     problem statement or link to the problem statement
2. Approaches:
    If a program contains more than one approaches to solve it. 
    Exploring each method one by one till *optimal* solution.

    1. BruteForce Approach
    2. Optimised Approach
    3. Optimal (if exists)
