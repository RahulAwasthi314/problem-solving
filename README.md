# Problem-Solving

This repository will guide us with the different level of programming approaches.

Sequencially we will continue with the different approaches we will apply in the problems related to data-structures and algorithms.


## Plateforms that we will use to solve problems -->

## Languages we will use as a tool to enjoy this problem-solving journey -->

1. [C/C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org)
3. [SQL](https://www.sqlite.org/)

## Data Structure topics that we will cover -->

    Array
    String
    Two pointers
    Bit Manipulation
    Stack
    Queue
    Heap
    Linked Lists
    Trees
    Graphs

<br/>

## Algorithms that we get to know in this journey -->
---
    1. Searching
        - Linear Search
        - Binary Search
    2. Sorting
        - Bubble Sort
        - Insertion Sort
        - Selection Sort
        - Merge Sort
        - Quick Sort
        - Heap Sort

## Program structure
---

1. Title :     problem statement or link to the problem statement
2. Approaches:
    If a program contains more than one approaches to solve it. 
    Exploring each method one by one till *optimal* solution.

    1. BruteForce Approach
    2. Optimised Approach
    3. Optimal (if exists)
